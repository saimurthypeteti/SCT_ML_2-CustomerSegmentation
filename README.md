## Project Overview

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers into distinct groups based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.  
Such segmentation helps businesses target specific customer groups for marketing strategies and product recommendations.  

---

## Features

- Segments customers into clusters based on income and spending behavior  
- Uses the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- Scales features for better clustering accuracy  
- Visualizes the clusters with distinct colors on a scatter plot  

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding **unsupervised learning** concepts and algorithms  
- Implementing **K-Means Clustering** using Scikit-learn  
- Applying the **Elbow Method** to find the best cluster count  
- Visualizing multi-class clustering results with Matplotlib & Seaborn
